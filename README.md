## Dog Breed Image Fetcher App

This Ruby on Rails application enables users to search for images of dog breeds. Users can simply enter the breed name into a form and select whether they want to fetch a random image or all images of that breed. Upon submission of the form, the application retrieves the specified breed's image from the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) based on the user's selection, and displays it on the page."
